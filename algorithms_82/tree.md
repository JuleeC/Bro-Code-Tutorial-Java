The top of the tree is known as the root
<br>
The nodes at the bottom are the leafs
<br>
Nodes in the middle are branches
<br>

### in family terms:
The top is the parent
<br>
In the middle there is the parent/child

at the bottom there is the child

When nodes share the same parent, they are siblings

### subtrees is a smaller tree held within a larger tree

## Some terms:
### size = # of nodes

### depth = # of edges below the root node

### height = # of edges above furthest leaf node
