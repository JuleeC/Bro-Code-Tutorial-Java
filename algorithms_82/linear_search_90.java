    //linear search = iterate through a collection one element at a time

    // runtime complexity: O(n)

    //Disadvantages:
    //Slow for large data sets

    //Advantages:
    //Fast for searches of small to medium data sets
    //Does not need to sorted
    //Useful for data structures that do not have random access (Linked List)
